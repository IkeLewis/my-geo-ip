* OVERVIEW

The my-geo-ip package provides country-level geo-ip services to
applications via a MySQL database. The data comes from the freely
available GeoLite2 databases provided by maxmind.com. Maxmind
currently offers the GeoLite2 databases in 2 formats MMDB (a
proprietary format) and a CSV format. If a distributed storage model
is desired, Maxmind's database may be more appropriate.  This package
uses MySQL to provide a centralized storage model. The API is written
in SQL and stored on the database so that an application only needs to
be able to log in to MySQL as the geo-ip user to use geo-ip services.

* SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS

Currently only Debian 8 is supported. The code has not been tested on
other Linux systems yet.

* SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

The MySQL user 'geo_ip' has read-only access to the database. However,
all input should still be sanitized before it is used in a query.  A
separate MySQL user 'geo_ip_updater' is used to keep the database
current. All updates to the database are made by the system user
'geo_ip' (not to be confused with the MySQL user of the same name)
using the MySQL user account 'geo_ip_updater'.  All downloads are made
with wget with 'https' as the specified protocol. See the MySQL user
manual and wget's man page for more details.

* INSTALLATION

Super user privileges are required to install my-geo-ip. At a terminal use either sudo or login as root.

1) Install MySQL if it's not already installed.

$ apt-get install mysql-server

2) Extract the files to a location of your choice.

$ tar -xf my-geo-ip*

3) Set the current directory to the location of the extracted files,
and then type the standard 'make' commands:

$ cd my-geo*

$ make

$ make install

4) Enter the (previously set) MySQL root password.

5) Set the password for the MySQL user 'geo_ip'. 

6) Set the password for the MySQL user 'geo_ip_updater'.

A bunch of output should appear and then after a pause the words 'Install successful'. Please be patient while the 170,000+ rows are being inserted. In repeated tests on a modest laptop, the installation took from 15 to 23 seconds.

* UPDATES

All updates occur automatically on the first Tuesday of each month.

* REMOVAL

Super user privileges are required to remove my-geo-ip.

There are two equivalent ways to perform the removal:

$ make clean

or 

$ make uninstall

* API USAGE EXAMPLES

** Example 1 (Terminal):

At a SSH or local terminal type:

$ mysql -u 'geo_ip' --password=<geo_ip_pass>

$ mysql > CALL geo_ip.info('012.034.056.078')\G

		//Make a call to 'geo_ip.info' via the public API.
		CallableStatement cs = conn.prepareCall("CALL geo_ip.info('74.26.183.54');");
		cs.execute();
		
		//Store the result set and the result set's meta data.
		ResultSet rs = cs.getResultSet();
		ResultSetMetaData rsm = rs.getMetaData();
		
		//Print all column names and their values.
		cs.getResultSet().first();
		for (int i = 1; i <= rsm.getColumnCount(); i++) {
			System.out.println(rsm.getColumnName(i)+": "+rs.getString(i));
		}

		//Print just the value of the 'country_name' column.
		System.out.println("\n" + cs.getResultSet().getString("country_name"));
	}

}
